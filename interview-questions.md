# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React? 

  Your answer: 
  Props are what allows the components in React to communicate and pass information back and forth. 

  Researched answer:
  In a React application, props short for properties, come from state. Props are a snapshot of state that are passed on to components tasked with displaying and/or letting a user interact with that information. Props are how you pass data from one component to another, from parent to child, as parameters.

2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer:
  A Document Object Model is the programming interface for web documents and HTML.

  Researched answer:
  Document Obeject Model (DOM) events are changes that occur in a document. These can be caused by the user or system. For example, the user may click on an element and that will generate an event. A DOM event can also be system generated, when the browser has completed loading the document, an event is generated and can be monitored using JavaScript.
  By including event listeners in the document HTML and/or the JS code, we can use DOM events to act as triggers that run JS commands. Event listeners are methods that trigger a JS function to run when a specified event occurs.

3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer:
  Object-oriented programming is based around objects.

  Researched answer:
  Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.
  OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained.

4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer:
  A float is a decimal while an integer is a whole number.

  Researched answer:
  integers in computer programming are whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or 0 (…, -1, 0, 1, …). An integer is also commonly known as an int. You can do math with integers and floats.
  A float is a real number taht can be either a rational or irrational number, meaning a number taht contains a fraction such as 7.0 or -99.35. You can do math with both floats and intergers. If you add a float to an integer you get a float. Ruby will consider numbers written without decimals integers and numbers written with decimals as floats.

5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: I cannot recall at this time but I will research implicit returns in Ruby.

  Researched answer:
  Ruby has an implicit return, which means the value of the last line of a method is automatically returned without using the keyword return.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable:
Instance variables belong to an instance of a class because instance variables belong to an object and object is an instance of a class. Every object has it’s own copy of the instance variables.

2. PostgreSQL:
PostgreSQL is an advanced, enterprise-class, and open-source relational database system wich supports both SQL (relational) and JSON (non-relational) querying.
PostgreSQL is used as a primary database for many web applications as well as mobile and analytics applications.

3. Ruby on Rails:
Ruby on Rails is an open source server-side web application framework written in Ruby. Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages.

4. ORM:
ORM (Object-relational mapping) is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible systems using object-oriented programming languages. ORM is a tool that allows developers to write SQL queries using Rails.

5. Active Record:
Active Record is the interface between a Rails application and the database. Rails has specific commands to create or edit tables in the database. Active Record has its own syntax to query a database. The syntax is similar to SQL queries with a Ruby-flavor. Active Record is Rails Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).
